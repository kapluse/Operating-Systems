Starting computer up is one function of an operating system. First, the power supply sends a current to the computer. The processor resets itself and find the firmware that contains start-up instructions. The process executes tests, instructions load to the computer's memory, and the operating system in memory takes control of the computer to load system configuration information.
Another function of an operating system is to shut down a computer. Power options include shutting down (powering off) the computer, placing it in sleep mode, or placing it in hibernate mode. Both sleep and hibernate mode are designed to save time when resuming work on the computer. Sleep mode saves any unsaved data to the computers's RAM while hibernate mode saves it to an internal hard drive.
All operating systems must provide a user interface. A user interface controls how data is entered and how information is displayed on screen. There are two different types of user interfaces, graphical and command line. A user interacts with menus and visual objects in a graphical user interface. In a command line user interface, a user types commands represented by keywords and abbreviations to enter data.
